# Lembretes

Lembretes is a Flutter project where you can save and see your reminders.
Once you enter in the app it will be shown the Actual / Future reminders page.
Here you will see all your actual and future reminders and it is also possible
to create new reminders. The other page has the past reminders. The actual reminders
(the reminders of the day) are on the Actual / Future reminders and in the next day the
reminders are shown on the Past reminders page.
